            “If a date doesn’t go well, and you’re not going to see the person again, instead of dismissing it as a disappointing waste of time, look at it as a valuable learning experience,” she told me. “What about them did you like or not like? How can this help you in choosing your next person to date, or prioritizing what’s most important to you? Is there anything you could have done to have had a better experience? More comfortable clothes? Different location? Asking to end it earlier?”

          <p>
            “Do not tell everything too soon. It’s better to reveal personal information about yourself gradually over time. Many people make the mistake of telling too much information to a date, especially early on in the dating proc You may believe that you want to lay it all on the table, the good and the bad, so your date knows exactly what they’re getting into or what you’re all about. But, if you tell all early on, your date is likely to feel overwhelmed and think you’re not trustworthy. Studies show that people do not want to hear too much too soon".

            Approach Dates With Ease and Curiosity — It’s Not Always About Finding “The One”

          </h2>
          <p>
            Focus on figuring out whether you like the person you are meeting rather than worrying about whether they like you. It’s normal to feel nervous before a date and wonder whether they will find you attractive and interesting.However, remember that a date is not a contest where the ultimate prize is approval. It’s an opportunity to meet someone who you could potentially have a relationship with, if there is a mutual connection.

          </h2>
          <p>
            I know, I know—two weeks?! But hear me out.Even after a great date, someone might need to figure out how compatible they think you two might be and what plans they can make. I urge you not to read a whole lot into how quickly they text you—as long as it’s within two weeks. That's plenty of time for a person to have decided whether and when they want to see you again. (After that point, it's safe to assume that they're unable or unwilling to prioritize even the idea of you. Next!)

          </h2>
          <p>
            I like to tell my clients not to let dates go on for more than 90 minutes. Why? That's enough time to get to know the person on a surface level and (hopefully) feel a spark, but not long enough that your brain starts getting carried away with the excitement of the potential. Dinner dates that spontaneously turn into a five-hour bar crawl or movie night can be incredibly fun, but they can also leave you in a state of confusion and despair if nothing develops from the marathon outing afterward

          <p>
            If someone doesn't respond to your first message or two, leave them alone. They probably haven't checked the app and will see your messages when they get back on, or they've seen your messages and simply aren't interested. Respect their time and accept their rejection."There are a million possible reasons that person didn't write back, and 99.9% of the time, that has nothing to do with your attractiveness and value as a person,"

            <hr width=50% color="crimson" />
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once you've been going on dates and talking to someone for a while, start having conversations to define the relationship. That doesn't mean you need to immediately jump into an exclusive commitment; it just means talking openly about why you're spending time together and how you each see the relationship progressing.

          </h2>
          <p>
            These things take time. You might not meet someone for your first couple months of online dating, and that's OK. There's a whole culture around dating apps that might take some time for you to adjust to, and if you haven't dated in a while, dating itself is a process that takes some time to warm and ease into. Be patient, keep engaging, and stay positive. If you need to take a break for some time, do that and come back when you're ready to dive in again.
            And don't forget to have fun! That's what dating's all about.

           "Choose a [partner] who values communication and likes sharing [their] feelings," says dating expert Evan Marc Katz. If you want a partner who will text you back and not leave you hanging, don't settle for someone who is only playing games.

            "If you really want to start a relationship off right, show that you're interested. Don't play games. Once games begin, they never end and someone always loses in a game," says dating expert John Keegan. I personally spent far too many years trying to be the "cool girl" — it never works.

           Being in a serious relationship is not a necessary component to having a happy life. And on that note, if an ex starts dating someone new, "remind yourself that it's not a competition," says Dr. Susan Edelman, a board-certified psychiatrist specializing in women's issues. "Relationships don't work out because of timing, compatibility, and other factors that are also important."

            Here's the thing about dating: Don't take it too seriously. Worst case, you will end up with a broken heart, but looking back, my most productive and creative periods in life have come after times of deep heartbreak. "It is not how long you wait before you move on and look for love again — it is how effectively you used that time to get brave enough to examine yourself psychologically," says Dr. LeslieBeth Wish of lovevictory.com.
